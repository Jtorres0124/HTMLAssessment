  During the quarintine I actually started school, during this time I wanted to better myself with an 
  education and I really got into video editing.
  I don't think im the best at it but I'm trying to learn more and possibly switch to camera operating. 
  Other then that I mainly played games and 
  tried to do things during the pandemic like go to disney animal kingdom and take a picture of all the animals in the park.
